# EchoBlend

[Downloads](https://github.com/VINXIS/echoblend/releases)

A rust app implementation of [EchoBlend-py](https://github.com/VINXIS/EchoBlend-py) using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui/) and [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe). 

**THIS REQUIRES FFMPEG TO BE INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM.** If you don't have it, get it [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z), and put the ffmpeg binary file either in your path, or in the same directory as the EchoBlend binary.


Follow the instructions on [eframe](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/) to test locally standalone/web, and/or for deploying yourself.
